## **Installation Guides**

### **Windows Installation Guide**

1. **Download Docker Desktop**  
   Download Docker Desktop from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

   This installs WSL and sets WSL 2 as the default. Restart your PC if required.

5. **Configure Docker Desktop**  
   - Open **Docker Desktop** and go to **Settings** → **General**.
   - Ensure "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is enabled.

6. **Verify Installation**  
   Open **cmd**, **PowerShell**, or **WSL** and run:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

   To test Docker, run:

   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```

   This will confirm that Docker is correctly installed and running.
